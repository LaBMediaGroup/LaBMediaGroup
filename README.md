# LaB Media

Metro Detroit's creative resource hub for filmmakers and writers.

## What This Is

A curated collection of tools, events, and inspiration for the local film community. Built as a side project, maintained with care, free forever.

**Live site:** [labmedia.work](https://labmedia.work)

## Features

- **Resources Hub** — Curated filmmaking tools, collaborators, stock footage, and community groups
- **Story Generator** — Roll the dice for instant film prompts (genre, character, setting, constraint, twist)
- **Events Calendar** — Metro Detroit film events, festivals, and meetups (local only)
- **Callboard** — Job listings for crew, cast, services, gear, and locations
- **Portfolio** — Studio work samples and production reference

## Tech Stack

- Pure HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks, no build step)
- GSAP for animations
- Supabase for form submissions (free tier)
- GitHub Pages hosting

## Local Focus

This site serves Metro Detroit filmmakers (~50 miles of Shelby Township, MI). Events and callboard listings are filtered to local area only.

## For Contributors

## Zero Budget Philosophy

This is a community resource, not a business. No paid services, no subscriptions, no backend costs. Features must work on free tiers forever.
