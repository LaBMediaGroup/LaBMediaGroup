## Applying resource updates from this repository

All of the resource data and layout changes live directly in this repo, so you do not need to cherry-pick snippets. To mirror the latest updates onto your live project, either:

1) Pull or fetch this repository into your environment, then deploy the updated files as-is; or
2) Replace the full `resources-data.js` and `resources.html` files in your project with the versions from the repository (copy/paste the entire file contents rather than partial blocks). This keeps the category filters, LaB Picks badges, and festival FilmFreeway links in sync.
